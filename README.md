# Supplementary Material for our Frontiers in VR Paper
Thank you for visiting this repo with Supplementary Material for our publication "Optimizing Performance and Satisfaction in Matching and Movement Tasks in Virtual Reality with Interventions Using the Data Visualization Literacy Framework". 

## Overview
* High-resolution versions of all figures are [here](https://github.com/cns-iu/optimizing-performance-in-VR-using-DVL-FW/tree/main/high_res_figs). 
* Additionally, you will find:
    * The [survey](https://github.com/cns-iu/optimizing-performance-in-VR-using-DVL-FW/tree/main/rui_vr_reflective) for the RUI VR Reflective user study (user study 2).
    * The [survey](https://github.com/cns-iu/optimizing-performance-in-VR-using-DVL-FW/tree/main/luddy_vr_reflective) for the Luddy VR Reflective User study (user study 3).

## Raw data
To ensure maximum reproducibility of our data analysis, we made anonymized versions of all the datasets generated during our two studies available on Zenodo: 
* Data from the RUI VR experiment cohort and the Luddy VR control and experiment cohorts from Luddy VR can be found at: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5658725](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5658725)
* The RUI VR control data has also been deposited to Zenodo at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5189516](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5189516) as part of another publication:

## Unity projects
To ensure reproducibility of our results, and to enable all readers to replicate the steps in our user study, we made the Unity projects for each study available on GitHub. Below are the links to each GitHub repository:
1. RUI VR (used to run all the manipulation tasks for the control cohort of the RUI VR study as well as the experiment cohort minus the Reflective phase): [https://github.com/cns-iu/rui_vr_user_study](https://github.com/cns-iu/rui_vr_user_study)
2. RUI VR Reflective (used to run the Reflective phase with a dataset generated by the RUI VR Unity project, see above): [https://github.com/cns-iu/rui_vr_reflective_vr_project](https://github.com/cns-iu/rui_vr_reflective_vr_project)
3. Luddy VR (used to run both the movement tasks and the Reflective phase of the Luddy VR study): [https://github.com/cns-iu/luddy_vr_unity_project](https://github.com/cns-iu/luddy_vr_unity_project)
